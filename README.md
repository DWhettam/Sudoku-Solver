# Sudoku-Solver
University of Hull Advanced Programming module coursework. 

The solver considers the "triple context" of a sudoku board (rows, columns and blocks) and attempts to solve the puzzle using naked single and hidden single techniques. The board is stored as a system of context index structures, with objects to represent an individual cell, a group of 9 cells to represent rows, columns or blocks, and a board, consisting of three arrays of nine cell groups.
